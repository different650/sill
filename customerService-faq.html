      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <ul class="accComponent">
        <li>
          <h3>How will my plant arrive?</h3>
          <p>Our number one priority is that our plants arrive in happy, healthy condition. You never know what
            adventures
            a plant can get into making its way to your home! Our plants ship in their nursery grow pot to allow for a
            safe and comfy ride all the way to your doorstep. Allowing plants to stay in their grow pot while being
            shipped helps reduce the risk of stress and shock that could happen if they were to be potted in a new
            planter
            before leaving the greenhouse.</p>
          <p>If you paired your plant with one of our planters, the grow pot will be securely nestled inside. For large
            plants and planters, including faux plants, the planter will ship separately from the large plant due to its
            weight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What if my order is a gift?</h3>
          <p>First, lucky them! Second, on our cart page you'll find an option to add a gift note. You can rest assured
            that all orders are shipped without pricing information and include directions on how to access our digital
            Care Library for plant care instructions.</p>
          <p>You can also let your gift recipient know something is on the way from yours truly by filling out this form - also linked in your order confirmation email. (Don't worry, we won't spoil what the surprise is or send them any marketing emails.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do I have to repot my plant once it arrives?</h3>
          <p>The short answer is, no. First, let your plant acclimate to its new environment. Place the plant in the
            spot
            you plan to keep it in. Let it settle in for about two weeks.</p>
          <p>After two weeks, your plant has adjusted-your home's light levels and temperature differ from a
            greenhouse!-and you can pot it into its ceramic planter, if you choose. You might notice your plant's
            earthenware planter is wider than the plant's nursery pot. This space is for your plant to grow into, should
            you choose to repot it. But remember, this is optional: as long as your plant still has room to grow in its
            nursery grow pot, and looks happy and healthy, you don't need to lift a finger!</p>
          <p>For some, the mantra 'plant care is self care' means the convenience of leaving it in the nursery grow pot
            and for others, it may mean getting your hands dirty to repot. Do what works best for you! Do not be afraid
            to
            try different methods for different plants. Learn more here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What type of plant care support do you provide?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Plant Care Library: Simply look up the name of your plant for easy-to-follow care instructions. Gift
              recipients receive instructions on how to care for their plants in their package, too.</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Tip: Forget the name of the plant? You can find the name of your plant in three places: your order
            confirmation email, the “Order History” section of your Account page and the packing slip included with your
            shipment when it arrives.</i>
          <ul>
            <li>Blog: Our blog has tons of articles on how to care for your plants, from how to find the right spot in
              your home to when to water and more.</li>
            <li>Workshops &amp; Events: We host plant care workshops, both online and in-person at our stores.</li>
            <li>Plant Parent Club: Join our Facebook Group of passionate plant parents. Community members post
              questions,
              share photos, and offer plant care advice.</li>
            <li>Customer Happiness Team: Finally, you can reach our team of plant care experts anytime:</li>
          </ul>

        <li>
          <h3>My plant arrived healthy but now it's not doing well. What should I do?</h3>
          <p>If your plant arrived healthy but is no longer doing well, reach out to us with photos. We're happy to help
            figure out what's going on. Sometimes plants need a few weeks to acclimate to their new environment: your
            home
            or office. However, if your plant continues to decline in health during its first month, we will replace it
            for free as part of our 30-Day Customer Happiness Guarantee.</p>
          <i>Tip: You can bring an online order into any of our shops for a replacement. Inventory online and in-store
            differs, so we recommend calling your closest shop in advance to ensure availability.</i>
          <p>If you purchased your plant more than 30 days ago, don't worry. We have plenty of plant resources and
            experts
            to help. Learn about all the ways we help you care for your plants here.</p>

          <h3>My plant arrived damaged, what do I do?</h3>
          <p>We guarantee your plants will arrive happy &amp; healthy condition. If not, we'll send you a free
            replacement
            as part of our 30-Day Customer Happiness Guarantee.</p>
          <p>While it's natural for live plants to show minor signs of stress after transit (and some dirt may slip out
            of
            the pot), if the damage is beyond minor blemishes*, reach out to us within 30 days of receipt. To expedite
            your request, please send photos of the damage, including one close-up pic and one at a distance. </p>
          <p>The guarantee applies to all online and in-store purchases within the first 30 days. We require photos as
            proof of damage and to help us improve our packaging process.</p>
          <i>*You can help your plant perk up from its journey by gently pruning any foliage damaged during the shipping
            process, such as bent stems or yellow leaves. Removing damaged foliage gives your plant back energy for new,
            healthy growth. Need more plant care support? Find additional resources here.</i>

          <h3>Why does my planter not have a drainage hole?</h3>
          <p>Our line of earthenware planters includes options both with and without drainage holes.</p>
          <p>Most of our small and medium plants ship in their nursery grow pot to allow for a safe ride to your
            doorstep.
            Added bonus: grow pots have drainage holes so you don't have to be as mindful when you water. They also give
            you the ability to use decorative planters that don't have holes-à la cachepot. The decorative planter
            serves
            as a saucer, catching excess water that drains out.</p>
          <p>If you choose a mini or x-small plant that ships potted, and your planter does not have a drainage hole,
            know
            our team has taken extra precautions to make sure that your plant is potted properly with a generous layer
            of
            lava rocks before the potting mix, to aid in proper water management. Lava rocks allow excess water to pool
            at
            the bottom of a planter, away from your plant's roots, thus reducing the risk of root rot.</p>
          <i>Tip: when watering your plant, add no more than 1/3 of the planter's volume in water, to avoid
            overwatering.
            Best practice is to feel the potting mix a few inches down first, and only water if the mix is dry.</i>

          <h3>Why does my plant look different from the website?</h3>
          <p>Live plants and small batch pottery will have variations in color, texture, finish, and size. While we make
            every effort to display our potted plants as accurately as possible, there may be subtle differences from
            what

          <h3>Does The Sill carry product from other brands?</h3>
          <p>We carry an assortment of products from independent makers and brands that share our aesthetic, values, and
            vibe. If your product is from a third party vendor or artisan, the brand's name will be noted under the
            product name on the product's page.</p>
          <p>Some of these products ship directly from the vendor. You won't receive tracking information for those
            items,
            but can contact our Customer Happiness team for support on all orders.</p>
          <p>We only accept returns on products made by third party vendors if the item arrived damaged. If your order
            was
            damaged in transit, please fill out our contact form and we'll get back to you within two business days. The
            form ensures we have what's needed to help you as soon as possible, including photos.</p>

      <h2>Winter Packaging</h2>
      <ul class="accComponent">
        <li>
          <h3>What is your cold weather packaging fee?</h3>
          <p>To ensure your plants arrive happy and healthy, we follow enhanced packaging protocols during the colder
            months. This includes extra cold weather packaging for each plant we ship. Hardgoods are not subject to this
            fee.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do you ship during the winter?</h3>
          <p>Plants make people happy-especially in colder months! When the temps dip, we take extra packaging measures
            to
            ensure your plants stay warm and cozy in transit. From November 15th on, all plants will be shipped with
            winter packaging (a small fee per cart), which includes shipper liners and heat packs. Shipper liners are
            made
            from recycled material, and are biodegradable and compostable.</p>
          <p>This usually does the trick but we happily replace any plants that experience cold damage under our 30-Day
            Customer Happiness Guarantee. Just let us know when your plant arrives via live chat or our contact form.
          </p>
          <p>In certain instances, we may hold your order due to weather concerns-if this happens, our team will be in
            touch to keep you in the loop.</p>

      <h2>Faux Plants</h2>
      <ul class="accComponent">
        <li>
          <h3>Why do you also offer faux plants?</h3>
          <p>We have customers who simply have restrictions-be it low light, busy schedules, small children, or curious
            pets. Faux plants give everyone the ability to still bring greenery and joy into their space. We believe
            that
            plants, in all forms, make people happy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What are they made of?</h3>
          <p>Our faux plants are made of a combination of fabric, plastic, wire, and foam. The larger plants may have a
            base comprised of concrete and wood.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>But plastic?</h3>
          <p>We hear you! Sustainability is important to The Sill. When it comes to our faux plant line, we use the best
            materials available to create a high-quality, long-term addition to your home.</p>
          <p>More broadly, the greatest and most immediate impact we can have is on single-use items across our entire
            line-like our packaging, which we're transitioning to be fully recyclable. We are constantly looking for
            opportunities to remove waste from our supply chain and make strides towards a more sustainable future.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How do I dispose of a faux plant?</h3>
          <p>Our faux plant line uses the best materials available to create a high-quality, long-term addition to your
            home. If at any time you're ready to relinquish your faux plant and do not have another home for it,
            pleasecontact usand we can help you find a local retirement or nursing home, school, thrift store, charity,
            or
            other community organization to accept it as a donation.</p>

      <h2>Monthly Subscriptions</h2>
      <ul class="accComponent">
        <li>
          <h3>How do your subscriptions work?</h3>
          <p>We currently offer three subscription types: Easy Care, Pet Friendly, and Orchids. Our Pet Friendly
            Subscription ensures your monthly plant is considered non-toxic to cats and dogs.</p>
          <p>Every month, subscribers receive one new plant and one chic ceramic planter. You can choose between 3 or 6
            months and planter color. In the case of Orchids, you can choose all white or a variety of orchid colors.
          </p>
          <p>The plants included in our subscription program are a mix of those available on thesill.com and specialty
            plants just for subscribers. We will try our best to provide variety and not repeat the same plant within a
            6
            month period. Please note planter shapes will repeat.</p>
          <p>* Subscription boxes can only be delivered within the contiguous 48 states. Promotions and discounts do not
            apply to subscription purchases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What is special about your subscriptions?</h3>
          <p>We do the work for you-curating new easy-care and non-toxic plants for you to experience on a monthly basis
            and delivering them, along with a chic ceramic planter, directly to your door.</p>
          <p>Our plants are sourced from local growers to ensure the highest quality and to support family-owned
            businesses. We guarantee plants arrive in happy, healthy condition, or we replace them for free. And our
            ceramic planters are designed by our team to complement a range of styles, and are manufactured by a
            women-owned pottery company focused on limiting their environmental impact.</p>
          <p>Not sure how to care for your new plant? Our Care Library includes specific care instructions for each
            plant
            and our team of knowledgeable plant parents is just a message away.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why does your pet friendly subscription cost more?</h3>
          <p>Subscription costs include your plant, ceramic planter, and shipping. Our pet-friendly option is $2-3 more
            per month because non-toxic plant varieties are not as commonly grown and therefore harder to source.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Do subscriptions come potted?</h3>
          <p>No. Plants ship in their grow pot, placed inside the ceramic planter. Simply enjoy as is or remove it from
            the grow pot and pot it inside the planter. It's up to you!</p>
          <p>If you prefer to fully pot your plant, it just takes a few minutes. Our recommended approach can be found
            here. And if you don't have potting supplies at home, you can show out plant care supplies here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>When will I receive my subscription box?</h3>
          <p>After the first purchase, subscriptions will recur ever 30 days until 3 or 6 shipments in total have been
            made. You will receive an email with tracking information once your monthly box is en route.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How do I pause or cancel my subscription?</h3>
          <p>Subscriptions are a 3 or 6 plant delivery commitment. At this time, you cannot skip a month or cancel your
            subscription.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I modify or swap my subscription?</h3>
          <p>No. At this time, we do not support modifying subscriptions, like changing your planter from one color to
            another or your subscription box type.</p>
          <p>This allows out team to better forecast and plan what plants and planters are needed to support our
            subscription program.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I gift a subscription?</h3>
          <p>Yes-and they make great gifts! You can gift a 3-month or 6-month subscription. Simply enter your gift
            recipients address on the shipping step of checkout. You can add a gift note in your cart before checking
            out.
