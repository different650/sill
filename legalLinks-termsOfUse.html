        <h3>4. Sign-in Name; Password; Unique Identifiers</h3>
        <p>If you wish to become a Registered User, you will be prompted to create an account, which includes a sign-in
          name ("<u>Sign-In Name</u>"), a password ("<u>Password</u>"), and perhaps certain additional information that
          will assist in
          authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future ("<u>Unique Identifiers</u>"). When creating your
          account,
          you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. Each Sign-In Name and corresponding
          Password
          can be used by only one Registered User. You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your
          Sign-In Name, Password, and Unique Identifiers, as well as for any use, misuse, or communications entered or
          payments made through the Website using one or more of them. You will promptly inform us of any need to
          deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name, or change any Unique Identifier. We reserve the right to delete or
          change
          your Password, Sign-In Name, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason and shall have no liability
          to

        <h3>5. Fees and Payment</h3>
        <p>As consideration for any purchase you make on the Website, you shall pay The Sill all applicable fees and
          taxes. Our third-party payment processor, Stripe, shall authorize your credit card, bank account, or other
          approved payment facility you provided during the registration process for the full payment of the purchase
          price, transaction fees, and applicable taxes, and you hereby consent to the same. All payments will be
          charged
          and made in U.S. dollars. By purchasing any Product, you agree to Stripe's terms of service and privacy
          policy,
          which can be found here: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/terms</a> and <a
            href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>You must provide current, complete, and accurate billing and credit card information. You must promptly
          update
          all billing information (such as billing address, card number, and expiration date) to keep your account
          current, complete, and accurate, and you must promptly contact us if your credit card is lost or stolen, or if
          you become aware of a potential breach of account security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your
          Sign-In Name or Password). You hereby authorize The Sill to obtain or determine updated or replacement
          expiration dates for your credit card in the event that the credit card you provided us expires. We reserve
          the
          right to charge any renewal card issued to you to the same extent as the expired card. If payment is not
          received from your credit card issuer, you hereby agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. You agree to pay
          all

          you agree to use and participate in subject to these Mobile Messaging Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy
          (the "Agreement"). By opting in to or participating in any of our Programs, you accept and agree to these
          terms and conditions, including, without limitation, your agreement to resolve any disputes with us through
          binding, individual-only arbitration, as detailed in the "Dispute Resolution" section below. This Agreement is
          limited to the Program and is not intended to modify other Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy that may
          govern the relationship between you and Us in other contexts.</p>
        <p><strong>User Opt In</strong>: The Program allows Users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by affirmatively
          opting into the Program, such as through online or application-based enrollment forms. Regardless of the

          messages at the phone number associated with your opt-in, and you understand that consent is not required to
          make any purchase from Us. You may expect to get occasional texts including alerts, surveys, welcome messages,
          customer win-backs, campaigns, giveaways, flash sales, upsells and abandoned checkouts. While you consent to
          receive messages sent using an autodialer, the foregoing shall not be interpreted to suggest or imply that any
          or all of Our mobile messages are sent using an automatic telephone dialing system ("ATDS" or "autodialer").
          <strong>Message and data rates may apply</strong>.
        </p>

          out. You understand and agree that the foregoing options are the only reasonable methods of opting out. You
          also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words
          other than those set forth above or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you from our list, is
          not a reasonable means of opting out.</p>
        <p><strong>Duty to Notify and Indemnify</strong>: If at any time you intend to stop using the mobile telephone
          number that has been
          used to subscribe to the Program, including canceling your service plan or selling or transferring the phone
          number to another party, you agree that you will complete the User Opt Out process set forth above prior to
          ending your use of the mobile telephone number. You understand and agree that your agreement to do so is a
          material part of these terms and conditions. You further agree that, <strong>if you discontinue the use of
            your mobile
            telephone number without notifying Us of such change, you agree that you will be responsible for all costs
            (including attorneys' fees) and liabilities incurred by Us, or any party that assists in the delivery of the

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>: In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy between you
          and Us, or between
          you and Stodge, LLC d/b/a Postscript or any other third-party service provider acting on Our behalf to
          transmit
          the mobile messages within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to federal or state statutory
          claims, common law claims, this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
          thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such
          dispute,
          claim, or controversy will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, determined by arbitration in New York,
          NY
          before one arbitrator.</p>
        <p>The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
          Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
          arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which The Sill's principle
          place
          of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the
          arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five
          years' experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject matter of the
          dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the
          AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the
          arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with
          the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). The parties also agree that the AAA's rules governing Emergency Measures
          of
          Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The decision of the
          arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in
          section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the
          administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all
          or
          any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have
          the authority to award attorneys' fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. The
          arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or
          recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate
          solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a
          plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. Except as may be required by
          law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration
          without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or
          provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
          illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or
          render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in
          court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration
          provision
          shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power,
          and authority to
          agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the
          performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of
          either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any
          further
          rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
          will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in
          full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall
          be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change
          this
          Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You acknowledge your
          responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing
          to
          participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, as modified.</p>

        <h3>15. Controlling Law</h3>
        <p>This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without
          regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- 16 -->
      <li>
        <h3>16. Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to the Agreement, the Site, or the Content (each, a
          "Dispute"), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration
          governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and
          binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO
          LITIGATE
          SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS
          COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT'S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS
          DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be
          resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for
          a
          limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to
          its
          then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in
          those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All
          applicable JAMS' rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website <a
            href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. Each party will be
          responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.
          Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not
          preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
          jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or
          online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. The parties may
          litigate
          in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
          enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the
          voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including
          electronically
          stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. As set forth in
          Section 18 below, nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of
          competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- 17 -->
      <li>
        <h3>17. Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually.
          To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii)
          there
          is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize
          class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
          representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING
          CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
          CLASS
          OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- 18 -->
      <li>
        <h3>18. Equitable Relief</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property
          rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore
          be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under
          this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive
          relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced
          above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of
          the
          federal and state courts in the State of New York for purposes of any such action by us.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- 19 -->
      <li>
        <h3>19. Miscellaneous </h3>
        <p>The following sections shall survive termination of this Agreement: "Fees and Payment" (until you pay all
          fees
          and taxes due hereunder), "Intellectual Property", "Registered User Content; Licenses", "Communications with
          Us", "No Warranties; Limitation of Liability", "Indemnification", "Termination of the Agreement", "Controlling
          Law", "Binding Arbitration", "Class Action Waiver", and "Miscellaneous".</p>
        <p>Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that
          provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in
          writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as
          expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us
          with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written
          or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for
          convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our
          successors,
          assigns, licensees, and sublicensees. </p>
