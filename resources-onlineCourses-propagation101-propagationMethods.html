            <h3>Stem cuttings </h3>
            <p><strong>Stem cuttings</strong> is the process of propagating a plant by <strong>removing</strong> a
              portion
              of <strong>a stem.</strong> </p>
            <p>Choose a stem with at least <strong>4-5 leaves</strong> and cut a 1/4 inch below or above a
              <strong>node.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="anomalyP"><strong>Remove</strong> a few of the <strong>bottom leaves</strong> on the stem to
              <strong></strong>expose
              nodes</strong> where roots can grow. This will also help the plant focus energy on root production.
            </p>

        <h4>Stem Cuttings</h4>
        <p>Nodes are the point where a leaf is attached to stem or where an aerial root may be on epiphytic plants.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After you take your stem cuttings, you can place it in a glass vessel filled with water so the bare
            stem/nodes are submerged in water. You don't want the top leaves to be in water. Place in bright indirect
            light, and refill water when it gets low.
          </li>
          <li>Or, you can insert the cutting into a moist potting mix. Place in bright indirect light, provide higher
            humidity, and water when the top 2-3 inches get dry. Rooting hormone can be used if desired, but isn't 100%
            necessary for cutting to take root.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pMargin">Examples of plants that can be propagated using stem cuttings include Pothos, Philodendron, Monstera,
          Dracaena,
          ZZ plants, Aglaonema, Maranta, Hoyas, Schefflera, Peperomia, Pilea, etc.</p>

            <h3>Leaf cuttings </h3>
            <p>Leaf cuttings is a unique way of propagating plants with the use of a single leaf. </p>
            <p>Depending on the plant, you can do so my removing a single leaf, or a single leaf with a petiole
              attached,
              or some can be propagated by cutting the leaves into segments which is commonly used for Snake plants!
            </p>
            <p class="anomalyP">You can also propagate most plants using a single leaf with a small part of the main
              stem attached also.
            </p>
          </div>

        </article>

        <h4>Leaf Cuttings</h4>
        <p>Succulents can be easily propagated with the use of a single leaf removed from the plant, allowed to callous
          over for a day or more, and then placed back onto moist potting mix to start rooting/develop new growth.</p>
        <p>You can also propagate succulents by placing plastic wrap over the opening of a glass vessel filled with
          water
          secured with a rubber band. A small hole can be poke so the end of the leaf is hovering over the water (not
          touching it).</p>
        <p>Overtime you'll see roots starting to form growing toward the water where it can then be planted into soil.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can remove a single leaf off a ZZ plant, or make a clean horizontal cut on a snake plant leaf, let
            them
            callous for a day, and then place the cut end into water (not the entire leaf).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pMargin">Examples of plants that can be propagated with just a leaf include most succulents like Echeveria, Hoyas,
          Sedum, Sempervivum, as well as Snake plants, ZZ plants, African violets, Begonia rex, Kalanchoe, etc.</p>
        <p>Other plants like Ficus or Monstera can be propagated with a single leaf as long as you have a part of the
          main
          stem attached that will contain meristematic tissue which helps new growth develop. Otherwise, if you just use
          a
          leaf without a part of the stem for these plants roots may grow but no new growth.</p>

            <h3>Layering </h3>
            <p>Layering is a simple process to encourage root development at a portion on a trailing stem, while still
              connected to the original plant! </p>
            <p>To add fullness to the base of the soil you can: </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="anomalyUl">Take a stem and place it along the soil at the base of the plant and make sure
                aerial roots are in
                contact with the soil. Floral pin can be used to keep stem in place. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also use this method to propagate a vining plant without cutting it first by: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Surrounding the mother plant with smaller spots filled with soil that the vines lay on top of.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <h4>Layering</h4>
        <p>Layering is a great method to help rejuvenate vining plants that have become bare at the base of the soil to
          add more fullness at the top. It's also a fool proof way to propagate a plant to develop roots before actually
          cutting it from the main plant.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layering to add fullness: take a vine from your plant and encircle it at the base of the soil where the
            aerial roots can be in contact with the soil. You can use floral pins or even a stretched out bobby pin to
            keep the stem in contact with the soil. With proper care and patience, overtime those aerial roots should
            further develop and anchor the stem into the soil to add fullness.
          </li>
          <li>Layering before cutting: before cutting a plant to propagate with this method, you can surround the mother
            plant with smaller pots filled with soil, and have the trailing stems be in contact with the soil in the
            smaller pots below. Overtime, the vines should root themselves into the potting mix where you can then cut
            the vines from the main plant and then treat as an adult plant. The soil can be pre-moistened prior, but you
            shouldn't have to re-water until roots start to develop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pMargin">Examples of plants that can be layered include any vining plants that develop aerial roots along the stems
          like Pothos, Philodendron, vining Monstera. String of Hearts is also commonly propagated using the layering
          method(Ceropegia woodii). Any plants that are also known as creepers/crawlers like Maranta can be layered and
          they will grow roots into the soil along the stem.</p>

            <h3>Root division</h3>
            <p>Root division is the process of propagating a plant by dividing it at the roots and separating it into
              several self-supporting plants.</p>
            <p>This method of propagation can be done for almost any well-established plant at the time of repotting.
            </p>

        <h4>Root Division</h4>
        <p>Root division is primarily done at the time of repotting an established plant. When separating, it’ll be best
          to keep the plants into a similar size or smaller container depending on how large the clumps are, rather than
          upgrading them into a container that was larger than the diameter of the initial container when they were all
          grouped together.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are, however a few plants that can only be propagated using this method. Examples include Peace
            Lilies, Calatheas, Ctenanthe, Stromanthe, and some ferns. However, mostly any plant that is large enough can
            be separated into several self-supporting plants if they can be easily separated by clumps they've created
            in the soil.
          </li>
          <li>The kind of plants that don't take well to being separated include all Palms, and even Bird of Paradise as
            they don't particularly liked their roots being disturbed.
          </li>

            <h3>Plantlets and Offsets </h3>
            <p>Plantlets and offsets are when plants generate ready made replicas of themselves, which makes them
              self-propagators. </p>
            <p>When a plant develops plantlets, these will usually form at the edges of leaves like on a Kalanchoe, or
              on long stems like on a Spider plant. </p>
            <p>Offsets usually develop at the base of the soil as side growths emerging directly from the stem.</p>
          </div>

        </article>

        <h4>Plantlets &amp; Offsets</h4>
        <p>Offsets usually have roots that have formed already beneath the soil. Therefore, you can either let these
          offsets grow with the mother plant, or remove them by root dividing at the time of repotting and plant them
          separately.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples of plants that develop offsets at the soil include Aloe vera, Haworthia, Bromeliads, Orchids.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pMargin">Plantlets may have roots that have already formed if you leave them with the mother plant long enough. If
          already rooted, you can cut the plant from the mother plant and plant it in potting mix and treat as an adult
          plant.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples of plants that develop plantlets include Kalanchoe “mother of thousands”, Spider plants,
            Strawberry begonia, Opuntia cacti.
          </li>
        </ul>
